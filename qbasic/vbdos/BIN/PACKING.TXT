This file contains a complete list of all files and directories on the 
distribution disks provided with this product. Files are grouped by
product component, numbers in parentheses indicate the disk number on which
the file is found.

==============================================================================
Files on the distribution disks are compressed (indicated by a "$" in the
file extension) and must be decompressed before they are used. The Setup
program on disk 1 decompresses files as they are installed. A separate file
decompression utility (DECOMP.EXE) located on disk 1 is provided for manual 
file decompression. The following table displays the compressed/uncompressed 
file extension mapping scheme:

An example of using DECOMP.EXE to decompress a single file is as follows:

C:\> DECOMP A:BC.EX$ C:\VBDOS\BC.EXE

This will decompress the BC.EX$ file from the distribution disk in drive a:
to the file BC.EXE in the C:\VBDOS directory.

This package comes with a number of demonstration and utility programs
written in Basic. These files are for informational and recreational
purposes only, and Microsoft makes no warranties, either expressed or
implied, as to their suitability for specific purposes or their correctness,
accuracy, or reliability. The entire risk as to the results and performance

ISAM character set and sorting order files.
The files below are used by Setup to change the ISAM character set and 
sorting order.  These files provide same functionality as their corresponding 
files listed above but contain different ISAM character sets and sorting 
orders (same files listed above contain character set and sorting order for 
English, French, German, Italian, and Portuguese).  Refer to the sections 
above for full descriptions of each file below.  The files below are used 
to replace their corresponding files above when a different sorting order
is chosen in Setup.  To change ISAM sorting order after you have installed the
product, run Setup again and select the "Build Additional Libraries" option.
